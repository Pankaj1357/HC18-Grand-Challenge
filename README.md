# My implementation approach:

<ul>
  <li>Implemented UNet architecture with a modified ResNet as encoder network in Pytorch.</li>
 <li>Applied various data augmentation techniques including distortions, random noise, random flips and random rotations.</li>
  <li>Trained the model using various loss functions eg. BCE, Dice, Inverse Dice and their linear combinations and compared the performance.</li>
 </ul>
